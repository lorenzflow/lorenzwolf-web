Hi! I am Lorenz, a recent graduate from the MSc Statistics at Imperial College London. Combining ideas from functional analysis and deep learning I wrote my dissertation on Variational Autoencoders on Hilbert Spaces to generate functional data. I was fortunate to be supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~aduncan/" "newtab" >}}Dr Andrew Duncan{{< /staticref >}} at Imperial College London and the Turing Institute. My studies focused on Statistical Machine Learning as well as Simulation Methods and Computational Statistics. Prior to the MSc I completed my BSc in Mathematics with Statistics also at Imperial College London.

On the application side I am interested in applications of Machine Learning and AI to Health Care among others.

I am always looking for fun projects in the field of machine learning, statistics and data science, so feel free to get in touch if you want to collaborate:)
